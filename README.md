# Beginner-Friendly Guide to Langchain
Welcome to my repository! As someone coming from a non-AI background, I wanted to dive into the world of large language models (LLMs) and integrate them into my daily work of writing software and automation tools to spike my productivity levels , just as rest of the world who have found numerous way to leverage generative AI to improve their lives.

During my journey, I found that while Langchain is a powerful framework, its vast documentation can be overwhelming, especially for those who are just starting out.

I created these Jupyter notebooks to provide a clear, concise, and beginner-friendly introduction to Langchain. This guide is designed to fast-track your learning process by focusing on the core concepts and functionalities you’ll need to start using Langchain quickly and efficiently—without getting lost in its extensive documentation.

Think of these notebooks as a “shortcut” to help you get up and running with Langchain, so you can start leveraging its capabilities in your own projects and work tasks, just as I have!

## How to Reference These Notebooks
To make the learning process smoother, I’ve divided the entire content into chapters. Each chapter builds on the previous one, so it's important to follow them in order for a clearer understanding of Langchain's core concepts and workflows. The chapters are designed to gradually increase in complexity, guiding you step-by-step through everything you need to know to start using Langchain effectively.

As of publishing this today, there are 8 chapters, and this is a work in progress. I’ll continue to add more content as time allows. Langchain is evolving rapidly, and staying up-to-date in this ever-growing AI space is essential, so I plan to keep expanding this guide as Langchain continues to develop.
